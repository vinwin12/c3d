## Introduction

This repository contains the files for the 3-D simulation and real-time rendering for the the Cyphyhouse project. This project establishes
an effort to research, design, and test using a framework called [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to enable the 3-D rendering of moving drones and cars used in the research instead of the frameworks such as Unity. The beauty of using 3.js (Three.js) is that it can be rendered in popular browsers with no installation required, esentially behaving as a website. This is convienient for people who want to view the drones/cars anytime and anywhere.

In the documentation below I aim to provide explanation of the project and the files in the repository, potential issues with this repository, problems I have faced, and a few next steps if one were to take up this project.
